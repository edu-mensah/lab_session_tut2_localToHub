Many of us use IDEs, and most IDEs have some kind of build management process
within them. However these files are always proprietary to the IDE and often fragile.
Furthermore they need the IDE to work. It's okay for IDE users set up their own
project files and use them for individual development. However it's essential to have a
master build that is usable on a server and runnable from other scripts. So on a Java
project we're okay with having developers build in their IDE, but the master build uses
Ant to ensure it can be run on the development server.
